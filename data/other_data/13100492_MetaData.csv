1,"Sources: Statistics Canada, Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), 2000/2001, 2003, 2005 and 2007; National Population Health Survey (NPHS), 1994/1995, 1996/1997 and 1998/1999, cross sectional sample, health file (household component); National Population Health Survey (NPHS), 1994/1995 and 1996/1997, cross sectional sample, health file (North component)"
2,"Population aged 65 and over who reported when they had their last influenza immunization (flu shot)."
3,"Comparable data are not available for 1994/1995 and 1998/1999 for the two components (household and North) of the National Population Health Survey (NPHS). Data on influenza immunization were not collected in 1996/1997 for the North component of NPHS."
4,"Rates are age-standardized using the direct method and the 1991 Canadian Census population structure. The use of a standard population results in more meaningful comparisons because it adjusts for variations in population age distributions over time and across geographic areas."
5,"When comparing estimates, it is important to use confidence intervals to determine if differences between values are statistically significant. Confidence intervals describe sampling variability and give an indication of the precision of a given estimate. Bootstrapping techniques were used to produce the coefficient of variation (CV) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)."
6,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) from 16.6% to 33.3% are identified as follows: (E) use with caution."
7,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 33.3% were suppressed due to extreme sampling variability and are identified as follows: (F) too unreliable to be published."
8,"Currently produced National Population Health Survey (NPHS) data (cross sectional sample, health file, household component) make use of new coordinated bootstrap weights, and as a result confidence intervals (CI) and coefficient of variations (CV) may differ from values previously published."
9,"Nunavut and the Northwest Territories (excluding Nunavut) came into existence on April 1, 1999. To facilitate comparisons, data presented in this table for the Northwest Territories reflect the current boundaries, showing the Northwest Territories and Nunavut as separate regions."
10,"The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period and (...) for figures not applicable."
