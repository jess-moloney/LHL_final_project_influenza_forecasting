 Predicting Canadian influenza case counts

## Project/Goals
The aim of this project is to predict the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza detections in Canada 1,2,3, and 4 weeks in advance.

## Dataset
Weekly number of laboratory-confirmed influenza detections in Canada (broken down by subtype) from 2015/2016 season to present (375 records).

Data were provided by sentinel laboratories across Canada.

Data retrieved from Public Health Agency of Canada FluWatch Reports.

## Motivation


## Hypothesis

Before looking at the data, I hypothesized that the following would be predictors of influenza detections

1. Health Indicators
2. Mobility Data
3. Google Search Trends
4. News Articles

I will examine these hypotheses by ...
